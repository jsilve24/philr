  "body": "### Overview\r\nPhILR = Phylogenetic Isometric Log-Ratio Transform. This R package provides functions for the analysis of compositional data (e.g., data representing proportions of different variables/parts). Specifically this package allows analysis of compositional data where the parts can be related through a phylogenetic tree (as is common in microbiota/genome survey data) and makes available the Isometric Log Ratio transform built from the phylogenetic tree and utilizing a weighted reference measure.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nIf you don't already have the `devtools` package installed, run:\r\n``` r\r\ninstall.packages('devtools')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe development version is maintained on GitHub, try:\r\n``` r \r\ndevtools::install_github('jsilve24/philr')\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, download and decompress package and then run:\r\n```r\r\nsource('http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')\r\ndevtools::install_local(‘x’)  # replace x with path to decompressed package\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nEach exported function in the package has been documented and we have also written an introductory vignette that is accessible by calling \r\n``` r\r\nvignette('philr-intro', package='philr')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJustin Silverman (@jsilve24), Duke University",
